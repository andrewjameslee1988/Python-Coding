#Ask what year it is
#Create rules/arguments for what makes a leap year using if/else statements.  Use modulos to make sure the division comes out with no remainders.
# 1. (On) Leap years are every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# 2. (Except) Leap years are every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# 3. (Unless) The year is also evenly divisible by 400
#If helpful create a chart to show the if/else statements and how they fit together. 
#Print exit message, add input for exit
